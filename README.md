# Bird Model - Stability Analysis

MATLAB/Simulink model for analyzing bird stability based on anatomical characteristics.

## Description

This project contains a simulation model to analyze the stability of birds using their anatomical data. The model calculates the center of mass (COM) and evaluates balance characteristics to determine stability.
